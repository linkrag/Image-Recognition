# Image Recognition 

A program created for study purposes, with the objective to recognize and classificate image.

I used TensorFlow to analyze the data and Python to code.

Together there is a modified program to search for images to create a database.

The searcher, can search up to 100 images save then on a directory and then create a CSV file for uses.
The search its a modified version of the code from Joeclinton1 repository (https://github.com/Joeclinton1/google-images-download)
Go there for further information about the searcher.

There is no license here, use as you see fit.
